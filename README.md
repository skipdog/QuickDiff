Show file differences between two folders

I initially wrote this application to help me quality review my code. 
The original application was written in Delphi and i've been slowy converting it to WPF.
Some of the original features have not yet been moved, like the file copy from source.
This is a work in progress so I still have a lot of work left to finish it off or get it in 
a state where it's usefull again.

Requirements:

This application require ExamDiff which can be downloaded from:

I have no intention of writing a built in file diff program. I will at some point
include additional diff programs like WinDiff and WinMerge.
